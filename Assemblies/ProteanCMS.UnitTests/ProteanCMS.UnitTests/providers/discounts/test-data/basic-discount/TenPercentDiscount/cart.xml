			<Experience>
				<p>
					<span>Aim at a trio of target shooting challenges in Bedfordshire! First up there's archery on the dedicated 30ft range to see if your arrow's trajectory is 'swift and true'. Next it's time to head over to the air rifle section of this large 36-acre site with both traditional static round targets and drop downs too. Strike them once and they fall, hit them again and they pop back up. Always guaranteed to raise a laugh!</span>
				</p>
			</Experience>
			<ExperienceDetail>
				<p>
					<span>Last but by no means least, it's the clays. Quite simply, this is what this centre does best. They have most types of target here, with mature hedgerows and trees that create sheltered shooting stands and almost hidden corners where you'll be lurking waiting to pounce on the clay. Happy shooting!</span>

						<ul>
							<li>Triple &amp; quadruple shooting fun!</li>

					<Body order="2">
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">A top-notch target challenge for four in Bedfordshire! Will you be the triple or quadruple hot shot winner when you and a friend have a go at three or four shooting sports at this renowned centre?</span>
						</p>
						<p>On the triple experience you'll all be trying out archery, clay pigeon shooting and air rifling during the two hours you'll spend on site. The quadruple voucher adds axe throwing into the mix.</p>
						<p>We love the fact that the hanging about is kept to an absolute minimum. It's all about maximising your time with the targets in your sights, with the aim for everyone to have fun in a friendly and safe environment.</p>
						<p>The archery takes place in a dedicated 30ft range and the selection of lighter 18lb bows means you won't be struggling to shoot on target, but they're sturdy enough to ensure the arrow's trajectory is 'swift and true'.</p>
						<p>The air rifle section is at the heart of this large 36 acre site. What we like about this range is that as well as traditional static round targets, you will get a go at drop downs too. Strike them once and they fall, hit them again and they pop back up. Always guaranteed to raise a laugh amongst the group.</p>
						<p>Then there are the clays. Quite simply, this is what this centre does best. They have most types of target here and the mature hedgerows and trees create sheltered and almost hidden corners to shoot from, where you'll be lurking waiting to pounce on the clay.</p>
						<p>And as for the axe throwing on the quadruple experience, who wouldn't want to lob axes into great chunks of wood? Great fun. And don't forget, these target challenge vouchers are for four people, so they're great value too!</p>

			<Experience>
				<div>What we love about this particular collection of cars is that it is pretty eclectic. We think it epitomises classic in the true sense of the word. That's to say, desirable, rare, iconic and even revolutionary in its own way. Not all of these cars for hire in Weybridge are high-powered fancy sports cars, but every one is utterly appealing and you will absolutely love driving them around Surrey.</div>
			</Experience>
			<ExperienceDetail>
				<div>As for where to go during your self-drive hire? Well, in Surrey you've got yourself a wonderful county to explore. There's everything from vineyards, gastro pubs and award winning restaurants, to motor museums, country clubs and castles. There are many stunning villages and winding roads to discover within your four hour hire period, so go out there and enjoy your drive!</div>

					<ShortDescription>
						<p>Surrey roadtrips driving the classic car of your choice around stunning countryside with passengers welcome to join you.</p>
					</ShortDescription>
					<Summary>
						<ul>
							<li>Classic car hire packages in Surrey</li>
							<li>An eclectic fleet of cars to choose from</li>
							<li>Spend 9 hours driving on public roads</li>
							<li>You can invite passengers to fill the seats!</li>
						</ul>
					</Summary>
					<Body order="2">
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">Book yourself in for a day of retro motoring with these classic car hire packages in Surrey! Take your pick from a fleet of classic cars that reside in Weybridge, to then explore the wonderful Surrey countryside. This is what going out for a drive was always meant to be like!</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">What we love about this particular collection of cars is that it is pretty eclectic. We think it epitomises classic in the true sense of the word. That's to say, desirable, rare, iconic and even revolutionary in its own way. </span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are offering you four different price bands of vintage cars for you. Indeed, not all of these cars for hire in Weybridge are high-powered fancy sports cars, but every one is utterly appealing and you will absolutely love driving them around Surrey on the open roads.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">If truth be told, we think the lowest price band is where the cutest cars feature. Of course, moving up to category B definitely moves you up a gear in the vintage car stakes, as does the category C car group. Car choice group D is for serious head-turners, with the most desirable Aston and Jags featuring, as well as the beautiful Porsche 911T.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">As for where to go during your nine-hour self-drive hire? Well, in Surrey you've got yourself a wonderful county to explore. There's everything from vineyards, gastro pubs and award winning restaurants, to motor museums, country clubs and castles. There are many stunning villages and winding roads to discover within your hire period too.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400;">And don't forget, these Surrey classic car hire packages are self-drive for one driver, but you are welcome to fill all available passenger seats. If it's a two seater sporty little number there's only room for one ride-along buddy, but if there are four seats it can be a veritable family excursion around Surrey!</span>

				<p>
					<span>At some point during the next 12 months the two of you will do a tandem bungee, accelerating from 0-60 in under two seconds as the earth rushes towards you! After a safety briefing and being weighed to get the Bungee rope length correct, it's time to proceed to the bungee cage where you are securely attached to each other.</span>
				</p>
			</Experience>
			<ExperienceDetail>
				<p>
					<span>The cage will then be slowly raised to around 160ft, your hearts pounding as the ground becomes a distant memory. Then it's time to jump. Adrenaline pumping, your jumpmaster will shout: 'Three'two'one'BUNGEE!' as you then launch yourselves from the platform and plummet towards the ground! You're sure to be filled with a euphoric sense of achievement and sharing this jump with someone else, you truly will have an unforgettable experience!</span>

							<p>It's a proper Skyfall - hold your breath and dream about the moment - with a friend or loved one. And remember, this is definitely NOT the end, my friend! The fabulous thing about a tandem jump is that you can share a great moment and a sensational thrill with the jump partner of your choice. Who will decide when to leap? Will you react the same way? What can you say on the way down? Will you be eyes wide open or wide shut as you rebound back skywards when the elastic bungee rope springs into action?</p>
							<p>Once you have finally reached the ground, you will be filled with a euphoric sense of excitement and accomplishment. Sharing this jump with someone else, you truly will have an unforgettable experience as a daredevil duo.</p>
							<p>Before you can take your tandem bungee, you will start off with a full safety briefing. You will then both be carefully weighed to ensure that the right length of bungee rope is used. Then it's time to proceed to the bungee platform where you are securely strapped on to each other and to the bungee cable.</p>
							<p>Once you are inside the cage, the instructor will make the final safety checks and the crane will slowly raise the platform to 160ft. Both hearts will be pounding as the ground becomes a distant memory and the wide panorama opens out around you. Then it's time for the easy bit - look down if you dare, but it's all about just going for it and jumping. Adrenaline pumping, you launch yourselves from the edge of the aerial platform and away you go as clinging on tightly to each other towards the ground.</p>
							<p>
								As this special jump is for pairs, we think it's makes a fabulous surprise present for your other half, or maybe a gift for a couple you know. And as for venues, there are tandem jumps laid on around the country. One thing's for sure, if you wanting to do a tandem jump to mark a certain occasion or even pop <em>that</em> question, it doesn't get much more whacky than this!
